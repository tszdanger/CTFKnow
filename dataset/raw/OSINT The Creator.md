# OSINT The Creator  
## Introduction

![Challenge Description](https://github.com/Niasio/CTF-

To solve the *OSINT The Creator* challenge, you just have to do some simple
research.  
Thanks to the description we quickly understand that the flag is on one of the
**profiles of the creator** of this challenge.  
It's indicated that the author is "**Thomas**".

Using the hint (which was: "*It's on Discord :)*"), you have to look for the
discord of dear Thomas.

## Researches

Two cases are possible:  
- Thomas has the name "Thomas" on Discord  
- Thomas doesn't have the same Discord name.

Fortunately for us, we see that an admin is called Thomas, it's probably him
:D.  
If it wasn't the case, we would have had to search the word Thomas in the
Discord server via the search tool, or find a social network and compare the
nicknames.

If he wasn't online, just look at the announcement messages and we would have
seen an admin named Thomas.  
We **click on his profile** and we get this:

## Flag

We see that **there is a spoiler** in its description, how about opening it?
