## Writeup

This is fairly simple stuff, easily translated into python. I installed more-
itertools  
(<https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)> for `set_partitions`,
which makes this problem  
trivial.

```python  
import more_itertools

x = 4  
n = 12

r = [2**i for i in range(n)]

parts = more_itertools.set_partitions(r, k = x)

summed = []  
for p in parts:  
   o = set()  
   for i in p:  
       o.add(sum(i))  
   summed.append(o)

print(len(summed))  
```
