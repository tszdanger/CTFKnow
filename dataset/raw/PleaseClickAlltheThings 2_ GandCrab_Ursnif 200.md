# Description

### Title: PleaseClickAlltheThings

Note: this challenge is the start of a series of challenges. The purpose of
this CTF challenge is to bring real world phishing attachments to the
challengers and attempt to find flags (previously executables or malicious
domains) within the macros. This is often a process used in IR teams and
becomes an extremely valuable skill. In this challenge we’ve brought to the
table a malicious html file, GandCrab/Ursnif sample, and a IceID/Bokbot
sample. We’ve rewritten the code to not contain malicious execution however
system changes may still occur when executing, also some of the
functionalities have been snipped and will likely not expose itself via
dynamic analysis.

```  
• Outlook helps, with proper licensing to access necessary features  
   ◦ Otherwise oledump or similar would also help but isn’t necessary  
• CyberChef is the ideal tool to use for decoding  
```
