physicist and computer scientist. She is the Roadmap Leader of the Quantum
Internet and Networked Computing initiative at QuTech, Delft University of
Technology.She is also known for introducing the noisy-storage model in

Challenge: We had the flag in notepad but it crashed. Please return the flag
to this Quantum Cryptographer

Because this is a memory dump challenge, my first assumption is that we need
to use volatility. I used the python script of volatility 3 for this challenge
but I know that a lot of people had issues running vol3, instead using vol2
which worked. Also some did not use the python version so it ran a lot slower
for them whereas for me it took no more than 2-3 minutes to completely dump
the memory for specific PIDs.

Moving on, the challenge mentioned the notepad program so that is what I want to dump. To start I ran `python3 vol.py -f memory_dump.vmem windows.pslist.PsList | Select-String notepad` which will list all the processes that were running and their id. The second part of the code is just the powershell equivalent to grep which I used to return only the line relating to the notepad application. 

{% highlight bash %}  
2452 1180 notepad.exe 0xe000021c3900 2 - 1 False 2023-08-03 21:20:36.000000
N/A Disabled  
{% endhighlight %}

The process id is the first value returned, in this case PID is 2452. Now onto
dumping the memory of that process using `python3 vol.py -f memory_dump.vmem
-o /path/to/desired/output/dir windows.memmap.Memmap --pid 1452 --dump`

This will take a little bit of time to run but after a couple minutes it was
done. To try and find the content I went with the strings approach. So trying
to dump all the strings first with `strings -e l pid2452.dmp` where the '-e l'
flag refers to the type of encoding it is processing, specifically 16-bit
littleendian which I found out about when trying to look through some
volatility notes. Now there were way too many strings for me to go through so
I tried using grep/select-string to find the flag.

Adding `Select-String "chctf"` and running resulted in another dead end as
there was a fake flag in the strings, *"chctf{this_is_not_the_flag}"*. The
fake flag made it clear that I am on the right track so I added '-B 10' to my
command so that it would display 10 lines before the grep match. Below is the
final command needed in both powershell and bash.

{% highlight bash %}  
strings -e l pid2452.dmp | grep "chctf" -B 10  
strings -e l pid2452.dmp | Select-String "chctf" -Context 10  
{% endhighlight %}

Now I could see a lot more data and there is a link to a github repository.

{% highlight bash %}  
Welcome to CyberHeroines CTF!  
No, No, chctf{this_is_not_the_flag} - not a leet format  
Try harder !!!  
Github: https://github.com/FITCF  
{% endhighlight %}

The user account has one repository which is called *secret* that holds a
single file that says *"well, there's nothing here!"*. If we look in the
history of that file we see a previous upload that contains the flag,
chctf{2023!@mu5f@!5y_1009}.
