## Solution:

Searching for this guy's name, I found his Tinder account:
https://tinder.com/@luvh4ck573

Inside his photo, there's another hidden message: ``nathan-rizz-blog67945``

Looking at it I knew it was a username, but I didn't know which social media
platform it belonged to.

I felt very stuck, but then I tried a different approach to searching, and I
found something interesting on YouTube:  
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=nathaniel+rizz+blog

Reviewing this YouTube channel, there's only one video and no other useful
information. Here is the link to the video:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEJdSXbglZs

Checking the archive page, there's an archive from March 14, 2024, but
unfortunately, I couldn't access it :sob:

By a sudden thought, I searched the title of this video on Google hoping to
find the account with the username ``nathan-rizz-blog67945``, and I also
accidentally found an email address from the archive of the video on YouTube:

Besides that, you can use Google Web Cache to view it using this link:  
https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEJdSXbglZs

Even though it will lead you to the current YouTube page, you can still view
the page's source to get the email:

I used https://tools.epieos.com/(Ghunt) to got this guy's real name behind
email address:  
I found this guy's Instagram account (same pfp as Google):  
https://www.instagram.com/nathaniel_sterling2/

So now we have two clues: one on Discord and one on Instagram  
Searching for "Subway" in Collingwood, Ontario, I found only 2 stores, and I
found the one near "McDonald's":

There is still one missing: ``nathan-rizz-blog67945``  
Cuz I didn't have it so I guessed the result and accidentally found the right
place is: ``King George Apartments``
