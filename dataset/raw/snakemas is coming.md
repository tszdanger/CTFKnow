#### Description:  
*Luckily, the most beautiful season of the year is near. I need to decorate  
my house with the coolest things ever! I found this super big mall on the
internet who sells the perfect decoration!!! But I don’t have money :( I need
a plan  
to steal the decoration. Maybe I can hack the webcams to watch the security  
footages and find the perfect moment to act! I can try my new hacking attack!*

*Here are the commands:  
1. e4 e5 2. b3 *

The title and the description of the challenge refer to the Christmas season,  
which will turn out to be an essential clue for solving the challenge.

The *commands* provided are chess moves and they’re the moves  
of the King’s Pawn Opening. Please note that in chess an asterisk is usually  
used to refer to an unknown result or a possibly incomplete game, but in our  
case it doesn’t really matter.

As I previously said, we are facing a King’s Pawn Opening. However, this is  
not the right answer!  
I am not a chess player so I struggled a lot with this challenge... But I
didn’t give up, I kept going!

After I was almost done with this challenge, I got an epiphany (luckily).

I thought: ”if I know that it is a King’s Pawn Opening, why don’t I just  
search it up online and add the *Christmas* keyword?” By doing so I found  
**this post** on Chess.com written by a user called X PLAYER J X who decided
to invent a chess opening to portray the holiday spirit.
