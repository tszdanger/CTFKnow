# b01lers CTF 2020 â€“ Life on Mars

* **Category:** web  
* **Points:** 100

## Challenge

> We earth men have a talent for ruining big, beautiful things.  
>  
> http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/

## Solution

The left menu of the webpage is made up of items calling `get_life()`
JavaScript method contained into
`http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/static/js/life_on_mars.js` file.

```javascript  
function get_life(query) {  
 //jquery ajax for querying server  
 /*  
 response = $.load('/query?search=' + query, function(responseTxt, statusTxt,
xhr).parseJSON(response);  
   {  
   if (statusTxt == "success") {

   }  
 });

*/  
 //alert(query);  
 $.ajax({  
   type: "GET",  
   url: "/query?search=" + query,  
   data: "{}",  
   contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",  
   dataType: "json",  
   cache: false,  
   success: function(data) {  
     var table_html =  
       '<table id="results"><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>';  
     $.each(data, function(i, item) {  
       table_html +=  
         "<tr><td>" + data[i][0] + "</td><td>" + data[i][1] + "</td></tr>";  
     });  
     table_html += "</table>";

     $("#results").replaceWith(table_html);  
   },

   error: function(msg) {  
     //alert(msg.responseText);  
   }  
 });  
}  
```

This method receives a string in input and uses it to contact a remote
service, i.e. `http://web.ctf.b01lers.com:1001/query?search=<param>` endpoint,
where requests are done to retrieve data.

The remote service is vulnerable to SQL injection.
