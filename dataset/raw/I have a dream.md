## Solution  
`speech.dat` is a binary file without any obvious structure. Given the clue of
the challenge name, and the name of the file, we can guess that `speech.dat`
may be the text of Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have a Dream" speech. We can
also guess that the encryption method may be XOR. If we XOR the beginning of
the "I Have a Dream" speech with the given ciphertext, we recover a key that
makes sense:  
```python  
>>> from pwn import *  
>>> plaintext = b"I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in
history"  
>>> ciphertext = open("speech.dat", "rb").read()  
>>> xor(plaintext, ciphertext[:len(plaintext)])  
b'BlackLivesMatterBlackLivesMatterBlackLivesMatterBlackLivesMatterB'  
```

The XOR key is `BlackLivesMatter`. We can XOR this with the entire ciphertext
to get the plaintext:  
```python  
>>> from pwn import *  
>>> speech = xor(ciphertext,
b"BlackLivesMatter").decode("windows-1252").replace("\n", "")  
```  
We choose `windows-1252` as the decoding because the plaintext from XORing
resulted in characters that are point codes in
[Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252). We also replaced
the newlines on a hunch because the last step of the flag recovery doesn't
work if you don't.

Finally, the challenge gave us a list of integers. These are offsets into the
resulting plaintext. This allows us to reconstruct the flag:  
```python  
>>> indexes = [8337,669,8972,3621,8898,5581,8720,1900,5208]  
>>> flag = ""  
>>> for i in indexes:  
...     flag += speech[i]  
...  
>>> print(flag)  
ROsAParkS  
```

## Flag  
**flag{ROsAParkS}**
