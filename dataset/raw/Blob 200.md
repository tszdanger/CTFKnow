# Description

### Title: Blob

Ha. Blob. Did you get the reference?

http://git.ritsec.club:7000/blob.git/

# Solution

The challenge is about git blobs (Binary Large OBjects). First we have to look
at the different commits using  
`git show`.

```  
$ git show a69cb6306e8b75b6762d6aa1b0279244cacf3f3b

commit a69cb6306e8b75b6762d6aa1b0279244cacf3f3b (HEAD -> master,
origin/master, origin/HEAD)

Here, we only see  one commit. However, if you go to the `.git/objects`
folder, there appear to be several commits. Looking at the next few commits,
we get the flag.
