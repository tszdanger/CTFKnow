## Solution  
* The binary implements **Blum Blum Shub algorithm**(BBS) which is a pseudorandom number generating technique.  
* The program asks you to play a game. If you say yes, you are given a "**seed**" number and asked to guess the next random number.   
* When looking at the binary you can determine that the program generates three values, one of which is given to you and is called the "seed".  
* By looking at the functions which generate these numbers, it can be seen that the p and q are generated according to the rules set for the algorithm (they must be congruent to 3 mod 4) however the seed is not.  
* The `rand()` value the p and q are based off is used to get the seed value, which ends up just being the random value multiplied by 1337.  
* We can solve this by writing a script which connects to the remote service, gets the seed value, and uses it to calculate the 2 random value which the remote server generates  
* Using [script2.py](https://github.com/HarshJolad/CTF-Writeups/blob/master/CyberHeroines-CTF-2023/crypto/Lenore_Blum/script2.py) we can get the flag  
* The functions in the script: `find_prime_congruent_to_3_mod_4`, `bbs`, `is_prime` are taken from the binary using `Ghidra`.
