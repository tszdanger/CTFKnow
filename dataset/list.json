The vulnerability allows for a buffer overflow that can be used to manipulate memory and gain arbitrary read/write capabilities.\n\nThe intended exploit involves triggering the double fetch to overflow a compressed file's size, leveraging freelist randomization to predict the heap layout, and corrupting a file's metadata pointer to achieve arbitrary read/write capabilities. The final step involves leaking and manipulating the `cred` structure of the process to elevate privileges to `root`.\n\nAdditionally, there are mentioned unintended bugs that can be found as an exercise, adding complexity and depth to the challenge.",
